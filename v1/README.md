# Prototype Full-Stack App

## Purpose

This GitHub Repo has been created as an prototype introduction to software development for myself, covering small amounts of HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React.

The repository and journal will be following the Udemy _[Full Stack Crash Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-crash-course/)_.
</br>

The Objective of the course is to produce a "Hacker News" style website which can be deployed and hosted externally with headlines, external links, user interactivity (voting mechanism) and persistent data.
